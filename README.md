# Email-SMS-Spam-Detection-System
Hey, this is my Email/SMS Spam Detection System

# Description:
I have developed an Email/SMS Spam detection system using Python and Pycharm.
It first involves cleaning of the SMS Spam dataset, then performing EDA on it. After that, it involves selecting the best
Machine Learning Models and classifiers, for classification. It also uses NLP libraries like NLTK for Data Preprocessing.

# Execution of the project:
1) Download the .ipynb files in jupyter notebook.
2) Download the .py file in Pycharm.
3) Also download the rest of the files.
4) Run the .py file in pycharm by using: streamlit run app.py
